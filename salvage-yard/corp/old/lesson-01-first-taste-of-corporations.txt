# Lesson 1: First taste of corporations

* This lesson and all lessons after it assume that you
  are in BitNode 3: Corporatocracy.
* This series of lessons were written based on bitburner v2.8.1

## What can a corporation do for me?

1. A properly managed corporation produces a TON of money.
   * TODO: how much? how quickly?
   * Note: some BitNodes heavily nerf or even disable corporations
2. You can use a corporation to bribe a faction to gain reputation
   * Unlike donations, bribes do not require accumulating 150 favor first
   * TODO: check
3. Unlike your money, your stats, the shares you bought
   on the stock exchange and many other things,
   corporations are unaffected when you install augments
   * TODO: check

## Create your first corporation

1. Go to City Hall in Sector-12
2. Click "Create a corporation"
3. Enter the name for your corporation.
4. Click "Use seed money"

* The option to create a corporation by getting seed money from
  the government is only available in BitNode 3. In other BitNodes
  you will have to spend 150 billion to self-fund it.
* Using seed money makes it cheap to experiment and learn

Beware: Do not spend too much time on improving this corporation
because you will sell it at the end of lesson 1 and start a new one.

## Corporations have their own wallets

Open the "Corporation" page from the "World" tab
of the navigation menu.

On this page you will find the "Funds" stat.
The initial value of this stat is always 150 billion.
Money spent by the corporation will always come from its funds
and never from your own money.

## Create your first division

1. Click the "Expand" button at the top of the "Corporation" page
   (next to the name of your corporation)
2. Select "Agriculture" from the drop-down
3. Enter the name for your new division
4. Click the "Expand" button next to division name

Congratulations! Your corporation now has 1 division, but it does
not yet have any employees.

## Hire the employees

1. Open the "Corporation" page and click on the name of the division
   you created in the previous step. This will open the division
   management tab of the "Corporation" page.
2. Scroll down to find the "Office Space" section. In this section
   you will see "Size: 0 / 3 employees"
3. Click the "Hire Employee" button 3 times
4. Use the up arrows in the bottom right corner of the
   "Office Space" section to assign one employee to "Operations",
   one to "Business" and one to "Management"

Now your corporation has 3 employees and is spending about 1.5 thousand
per second on salaries, but is still not producing enything because
your division needs to buy water and chemicals.

## Buy the input materials

On your division management tab you can see

0.5 Water + 0.2 Chemicals => 1 Plants + 1 Food

This means that your division consumes "Water" and "Chemicals" and
turns them into "Plants" and "Food". Water, chemicals, plants
and food are all "materials". Most industries consume materials.
Some industries produce and sell materials, some industries produce
and sell "products". Products will be discussed in future lessons.

To buy input materials you will need "Smart Supply":
1. Open the "Corporation" page
2. Scroll down to the "Unlocks" section
3. In this section click the button that says
   "$25.000 b" next to "Smart Supply"
4. On your division management tab click the
   "Configure Smart Supply" button. It will open a pop-up.
5. In the pop-up toggle "Enable Smart Supply" and leave the other
   toggles in their default positions
6. Close the pop-up

In a future lesson I will discuss a better way of
buying input materials.

On your division management tab there is a progress bar that
shows your corporation cycling through 5 states:

Start -> Purchase -> Production -> Export -> Sale

* When your corporation enters the "Purchase" state,
  all your divisions will buy materials that you
  (or Smart Supply, if enabled) ordered them to buy,
  but only if there is enough free space in the "Warehouse".
* When your corporation enters the "Production" state,
  all your divisions will consume input materials and turn
  them into products or output materials, but only if there
  are enough input materials in the "Warehouse".
  Some industries like "Agriculture" also need free space "Warehouse"
  because their outputs take up more space than their inputs.

Now you are producing plants and food, but you are just storing
them in your warehouse instead of selling them.

## Sell the output materials

The right half of the division management tab manages the warehouse.

* When your corporation enters the "Sale" state,
  all your divisions will sell materials or products
  at the prices you set. 

1. In the "Food" section click the "Sell" button.
   Do not be alarmed by the colour of the
   text on this button. The button will open a pop-up.
2. At the bottom of the pop-up there are two input fields
   and a "Confirm" button. Unfortunately there is no
   spacing between the two input fields so it will
   at first glance look like there is only one field
3. Enter "MAX" in the left input field. This sets no
   limit on the amount of food you sell per second. 
4. Enter "MP" in the right input field. This tells
   your division to sell food at the "market price"
   and to automatically adjust the sale price when
   the "market price" changes.
   * High prices reduce how much you are able to sell per second
   * Low prices increase how much you are able to sell per second
5. Press the "Confirm" button
6. Configure your division to sell "Plants" too. Use "MAX" and "MP"
   like above.

Now your corporation is selling plants and food and is turning
a (very small) profit (about one thousand per second). Note that all
the money earned in the "Sale" state goes into the funds of
the corporation. You do not earn any money from your corporation yet.

## Dividends

The last game mechannic I will demonstrate in this lesson
is dividends. Dividends are how you earn money from
your corporation.

Beware: in this lesson we will "take a corporation public"
much earlier that would be optimal. This will drastically reduce
it's ability to quickly grow. That is ok because:
1. We are doing this just to demonstrade the mechannic
2. Starting this corporation did not cost us anything
   thanks to "seed money"
3. We will sell this corporation and start over soon afterwards

To set dividends:
1. Click the "Go Public" button on the "Corporation" page.
   It will open a pop-up
2. In the pop-up type 0 into the input field that tells you how many
   shares to issue
3. Click the "Go Public" button in the pop-up
4. Click the "Issue Dividends" button on the "Corporation" page.
   It will open a pop-up
5. In the pop-up type a number between 1 and 100 into
   the input field
6. Click the "Allocate Dividend Percentge" button

Now a percentge of the profits the corporation makes will
be siphoned off from its funds and divided between its shareholders.

You will likely notice that the money you get
is substantialy less than P*D*O/T,
where P="Total Profit", D="Dividend Percentge",
O="Owned Stock Shares", T="Total Stock Shares".
This is because of taxes.

TODO: insert graph of taxes

## Starting over

Beware: it will usually be very inefficient to sell
a corporation. It takes time to grow a corporation
into a higly profitable money generator. If you sell it,
the process starts over from the beginning.   

Sell as many shares as you have minus one (the game forces
you to keep at least one share) and then start over:
1. Click the "Sell Shares" button on the "Corporation" page.
   It will open a pop-up.
2. In the pop-up type the number of shares to sell into the
   inut field.
3. Click the "Sell shares" button. This will earn you some money.
   In my testing I got 54 billion, but your milage may vary.
   If I self-funded the corporation, this would be a net
   loss of 96 billion. Fortunately I used seed money making
   this a 54 billion net gain.
4. Optional: use the money to buy more RAM for your home
   computer. You will likely want to at least partially
   automate the management of your corporation, but
   corporation API functions cost a lot of RAM. Buying
   home RAM solves this problem.
5. Click the "Sell CEO Position" button on the "Corporation" page.
   Note: "Selling" the CEO position will never earn you any money
   regardless of the number of shares you have. This might be a bug.
   Clicking this button will open a pop-up.
6. In the pop-up enter a name for your next corporation and click
   the "Use seed money" button.
   
## Recap

Corporations:
1. Hire employees
2. Buy materials
3. Transform materials into other materials and/or products 
4. Sell products and/or materials they produce at a profit
5. Siphon off a configured percentge of the profits
   as dividends for investors

The remainder of the lessons will discuss how to grow your
corporation and how to optimize it for faster growth
